- 👋 Hi, I’m @PavthePekka
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, robotics (namely Raspberry Pis) and cybersecurity
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Delphi (fluent), Python (fluent) and a little bit of C, JS and Html ( still learning :) ) on the side
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving Delphi as that is the language I am most familiar with at the moment ( I am a bit rusty at the others as I've mainly been programming in Delphi this year.
- 📫 How to reach me: pavannaidoo6@gmail.com for programming/ collabarative/ school related communication
- I am a student at the moment and am eager for the chance to collaborate with other developers. I am a self taught programmer who started at 14 years old. I have honestly fallen in love with programming and would
be honoured if anyone would consider allowing me to collaborate with them on your their projects.
